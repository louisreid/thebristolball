        <h1></h1>
        <p>
            i'm a free man technically but still I feel held by british inhibition,
and I know actions speak louder, but still I hope these words create some friction
This isn't about me; some western idealism or grand dreams
this is about the unread news, the underground, the unseen,
Those tonight, tomorrow, this year –who will be set to work our systems,
so I pray this ball births miraculous re-actions, urging the world at large to listen.
It's a sort of ball and chain this consumers dream
where sex, clothes and food can come so quick and cheap
I hope these punch lines and kick rhymes break through walls of deceit
so those kept against their will, can jump up and just leave

So let us care, cry and hurt with them who suffer,
my poetic talk is cheap without cost, calls my bluff?
Coz I'm content with giving a measly five pound a month,
enough to give me pride but not enough to take the brunt
or the whip, or the sting of the price paid to be a slave-
i'm free to cancel my funds but they can't just walk out today
I'm happy to talk sign ups and activism but I'm passive aggressive at best,
about the oppressed -damned- it's serious though i'm hardly even stressed
hardly restless at night - with the plight of the many,
I breeze past many blogs, videos and statistics though apathy I have plenty..

Some say we become Numb to the pain, to the truth, of the modern slave-
like we're working against Wilberforce’s and his crew with our lack of action today
he said “You may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know.”
when I don't spread the word, sign the petition, report the incident I guess we reap what we sow
so let's legislate with everything, and put away our ignorance
because there's slavery in this city but it's too easy to be indifferent
and it's easy to forget when your high life is sponsored by their plight
and our ignorance is bliss so heap on the polite, the light and nice.

Father forgive us for we know not what we've done,
let us end what you willed never to have begun.

    Jesus is depicted as asian, african, european, but it's the broken he knows best
    his mission is ours; freedom for the prisoners, to release the oppressed
    and he longs to turn us all free, making us co heirs sharing his glory,
    cause god is freedom so let's make their lack of it history.
